\section{Report}

%Describe your learning/process so far on the survey paper.  I expect this to be short. 

For the survey paper assignment, I've decided to team up with Bill Michael. So far Bill and I have come up with an idea to write a survey paper on unsupervised learning. Since it's a broad field, we had to narrow it down. So we are gonna focus on unsupervised learning applied to image segmentation. When searching for papers, I went straight to the proceedings from this year's CVPR. There were many interesting papers about unsupervised larning. Since it's a recent conference, I think it's a good idea to start with some papers from there to write a good survey paper. Bill and I have each saved many references in a group library from Zotero and we are browsing through them. As we browse, we are trying to identify the different classes so we can group them in a tree-like or cube-like classification. We have also written the abstract and we are discussing the structure of the paper. 

Inside my repo I have cloned the overleaf project. In this folder you can find all the files for the tex file.
